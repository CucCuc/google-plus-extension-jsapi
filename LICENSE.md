LICENSE For Usage
=================

This software is 100% free. It would be ethical if you mention me in your
extension that your using this API within an internal license file, and
let me know what you create with it. I would be greatly happy!

I spent a good amount of time creating this, so being recognized is the
only thing I ask in return of supplying free software. Being recognized
is a good thing because it helps bring more developers to this project
to help make it even more awesome.

I just don't like developers who steal peoples code and rebrand it as
their own, it is ethically incorrect, but there is nothing I can do
about that.
